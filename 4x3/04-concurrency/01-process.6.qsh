  + Kind of like erlang, maybe?
    but with outboxes as well as inboxes

  - proc = (environment, bytecode)

  - An environment stores a map (Int => Channel)
     { 0 = stdin; 1 = stdout; 2 = stderr; ... }

  - channel: readable? writeable?

  - CSP-style: reader and writer must be present!

    q = & make-queue 1G -backpressure=exponential

  > proc exits when blocked channel closes
