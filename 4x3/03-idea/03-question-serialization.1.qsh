  (>o.o)._/ real ARGV can only be strings!
       what happens when you use something else?

  - this is why es serializes lambdas

  - some have obvious answers, some don't

  - override an internal env method to customize

  - there is still *some* marshalling overhead,
    but only when actually translating different
    concepts

  - actual goal:
    no marshalling overhead to use lists as argv,
    envs as environments, channels like files, etc.
