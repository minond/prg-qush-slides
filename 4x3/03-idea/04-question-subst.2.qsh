  (,-~-)._/ shell functions can't return values!
            neither can external programs!
  does a lambda return? can you substitute values?

  - shell functions have stdout

  - idea: lua-style *multiple return values*
    from stdout

    (f x y) : splice stdout into the expression

      EXAMPLE:
      # processes in parallel
      producer | each ( => ... )

      # collects all values first
      for [(producer)] ( => ... )
