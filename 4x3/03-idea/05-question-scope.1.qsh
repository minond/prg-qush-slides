  (7e.e)-_/ shells usually have *dynamic scope*.
    how do closures work? how do you tell
    the difference between lexical and dynamic?

    - idea: different syntax

        $my-dynamic-variable

        %my-lexical-variable

        :echo this runs /bin/echo

    - lambda creation: collect lexical values

    - lambda exec: merge lexical values into
      caller's env
