 Q:

         +-------------------------------+
         |  Is it possible to design a   |
         | language that meets the needs |
         |   of shell programmers, but   |
         |    without the drawbacks?     |
         +-------------------------------+

          If so, what kinds of programming
          paradigms naturally arise?
