                          THE PROBLEMS

* implementing languages on new platforms
  that do not have mature tools for parsing

* Parse error messages could be improved

* Why are macros harder when it's not lisp?
  - exposes the entire ast spec to the runtime

* idea: a generic toolset for parsing, with
  a generic pattern-matching system for skeleton
  tree transformations *using* skeleton trees

  Skel -> (Skel -> Skel)
