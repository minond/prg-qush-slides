  Option 2.
  "A new shell that fixes cosmetic problems"

  + fish, zsh
    - aim for sh-compatibility
    - also inherit many of the Bad Parts

  + rc shell, es shell
    - better quoting syntax, less "gotchas"
    - es adds closures by serializing as strings

      ; x = @ y{ z = @ { echo $y } }
      ; $x 3
      ; echo $z
      %closure(y=3)@ { echo $y }

       must parse at call time (!)
